# MessageList

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.

## NB: Breaking change:
npm module `ngx-infinite-scroll` needs fixed: in `ngx-infinite-scroll.es5.js` - replace the following imports with `import { of, fromEvent } from 'rxjs';`:

`import { of } from 'rxjs/observable/of';`
`import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs/observable/fromEvent';`
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
